Course Projects for Intro to Embedded Systems (Undergraduate) & Embedded Systems Design (Graduate level)

Undergraduate Project Description:
Our term project for the course was to repurpose code that was originally given to detect light 
and temperature in a room using temperature and light sensors. So, we rewired a remote control 
and utilized those sensors to control the movement of the vehicle's motors via a joystick and
MSP430 microcontroller.

Graduate Project Description:
Control a Parrot Jumping Sumo drone (a.k.a. “Sumo”) via Wi-Fi using an accelerometer, Node.js and Raspberry Pi3.
